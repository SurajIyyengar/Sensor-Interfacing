# Sensor-Interfacing
Interfacing various sensors for hardware-modelling. 
I wrote these codes while learning various sensors and how to implement them. As a beginner it was difficult for me to directly obtain the necessary performance from the sensors. I obviously had to conclude any program by analysing the values obtained. So, I made codes for each sensor to just obtain their values. Hopefully you find it useful.
